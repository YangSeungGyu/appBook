On that first morning, when Sara sat at 
Miss Minchin's side, aware that the 
whole schoolroom was devoting itself 
to observing her, she had noticed 
very soon one little girl, about her own
age, who looked at her very hard with 
a pair of light, rather dull, blue eyes. 
------------------------------
[devoting:기울이다,바치다,전념하다]
------------------------------

She was a fat child who did not look 
as if she were in the least clever, but 
she had a good-naturedly pouting 
mouth. 
------------------------------
[pouting]
------------------------------

Her flaxen hair was braided in a tight 
pigtail, tied with a ribbon, and she had 
pulled this pigtail around her neck, and 
was biting the end of the ribbon, resting
her elbows on the desk, as she stared 
wonderingly at the new pupil. 
------------------------------
[flaxen]
[braided]
------------------------------

When Monsieur Dufarge began to speak
to Sara, she looked a little frightened. 
and when Sara stepped forward and, 
looking at him with the innocent, 
appealing eyes, answered him, without 
any warning, in French, the fat little girl
gave a startled jump, and grew quite red
in her awed amazement. 
------------------------------
[startled:놀란]
------------------------------

Having wept hopeless tears for weeks 
in her efforts to remember that 
"la mere" meant "the mother," and 
"le pere," "the father,"-- when one spoke
sensible English--it was almost too much
for her suddenly to find herself listening
to a child her own age who seemed not
only quite familiar with these words, but
apparently knew any number of others, 
and could mix them up with verbs as if 
they were mere trifles.
------------------------------
[weep:눈물흘리다]
[trifle: 약간, 하찮은것]
------------------------------

She stared so hard and bit the ribbon 
on her pigtail so fast that she attracted
the attention of Miss Minchin, who, 
feeling extremely cross at the moment, 
immediately pounced upon her.
------------------------------
[pounce 덮치다,덤비다]
------------------------------

"Miss St. John!" she exclaimed severely. 
"What do you mean by such conduct? 
Remove your elbows! Take your ribbon
out of your mouth! Sit up at once!"

Upon which Miss St. John gave another
jump, and when Lavinia and Jessie 
tittered she became redder than  ever
--so red, indeed, that she almost looked
as if tears were coming into her poor, 
dull, childish eyes. 
------------------------------
[titter:킥킥거리다]
------------------------------

and Sara saw her and was so sorry for 
her that she began rather to like her 
and want to be her friend. 
It was a way of hers always to want to 
spring into any fray in which someone
was made uncomfortable or unhappy.
------------------------------
[spring:불쑥]
[fray:싸움,신경이 날카로워지는]
------------------------------

"If Sara had been a boy and lived a few
centuries ago," her father used to say, 
"she would have gone about the country
with her sword drawn, rescuing and 
defending everyone in distress. 
She always wants to fight when she 
sees people in trouble."

So she took rather a fancy to fat, slow, 
little Miss St. John, and kept glancing 
toward her through the morning. 
------------------------------
[fancy:흥미를 느끼다]
------------------------------

She saw that lessons were no easy 
matter to her, and that there was no 
danger of her ever being spoiled by 
being treated as a show pupil. 

Her French lesson was a pathetic thing. 
Her pronunciation made even Monsieur
Dufarge smile in spite of himself, and 
Lavinia and Jessie and the more 
fortunate girls either giggled or looked 
at her in wondering disdain. 
------------------------------
[spite:괴롭히다]
[disdain:없신여김]
------------------------------

But Sara did not laugh. 
She tried to look as if she did not hear 
when Miss St. John called "le bon pain,"
"lee bong pang." She had a fine, hot 
little temper of her own, and it made 
her feel rather savage when she heard 
the titters and saw the poor, stupid, 
distressed child's face.
