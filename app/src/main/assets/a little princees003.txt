"Here we are, Sara," said Captain Crewe,
making his voice sound as cheerful
as possible. Then he lifted her out of
the cab and they mounted the steps and
rang the bell.
Sara often thought afterward that the house
was somehow exactly like Miss Minchin.
It was respectable and well furnished, but
everything in it was ugly.
and the very armchairs seemed to have hard
bones in them.
In the hall everything was hard and
polished even the red cheeks of the
moon face on the tall clock in the corner
had a severe varnished look.
The drawing room into which they were
ushered was covered by a carpet with a
square pattern upon it, the chairs were
square, and a heavy marble timepiece
stood upon the heavy marble mantel.

As she sat down in one of the stiff
mahogany chairs, Sara cast one of her
quick looks about her.

"I don't like it, papa," she said. "But
then I dare say soldiers even brave ones
don't really like going into battle."
Captain Crewe laughed outright at this.
He was young and full of fun, and he
never tired of hearing Sara's queer
speeches.


"Oh, little Sara," he said. "What shall
I do when I have no one to say solemn
things to me? No one else is as solemn
as you are."
"But why do solemn things make you laugh
so?" inquired Sara.


"Because you are such fun when you say
them," he answered, laughing still more.
And then suddenly he swept her into his
arms and kissed her very hard, stopping
laughing all at once and looking almost
as if tears had come into his eyes.

It was just then that Miss Minchin entered
the room. She was very like her house,
Sara felt: tall and dull, and respectable
and ugly.
She had large, cold, fishy eyes, and
a large, cold, fishy smile.
It spread itself into a very large smile
when she saw Sara and Captain Crewe.
She had heard a great many desirable
things of the young soldier from the lady
who had recommended her school to him.
Among other things, she had heard that he
was a rich father who was willing to
spend a great deal of money on his
little daughter.

"It will be a great privilege to have
charge of such a beautiful and promising
child, Captain Crewe," she said, taking
Sara's hand and stroking it.
"Lady Meredith has told me of her unusual
cleverness. A clever child is a great
treasure in an establishment like mine."

Sara stood quietly, with her eyes fixed
upon Miss Minchin's face.
She was thinking something odd, as usual.
"Why does she say I am a beautiful child?"
she was thinking.
"I am not beautiful at all. Colonel
Grange's little girl, Isobel, is beautiful.
She has dimples and rose-colored cheeks,
and long hair the color of gold.
I have short black hair and green eyes.
besides which, I am a thin child and not
fair in the least. I am one of the ugliest
children I ever saw.
She is beginning by telling a story."
