once on a dark winter's day, when the yellow
fog hung so thick and heavy in the streets 
of London. that the lamps where lighted and 
the shop windows blazed with gas as they 
go at night, and odd-looking little girl sat in 
a cab with her father, and was driven rather 
slowly throught the big thoroughfares.

She sat with her feet tucked under her,
and leaned against her father, who held
her in his arm, as she stared out of the
window at the passing people with a queer
old fashioned thoughtfulness in her big
eyes.

queer[기묘한,유별난]

she was such a little girl that one did
not expect to see such a look on her small
face.
It would have been an old look for a child 
of twelve, and Sara Crewe was only seven.
The fact was, howerever, that she was
alwasy deraming and thinking odd things,
and could not herself remember any time
when she had not been thinking things
about grown-up people and the world
belonged to.
She felt as if she had lived a long,
long time.


At this moment she was remembering 
the boyage she had just made form Bombay 
with her father, Captain Crewe. She was 
thinking of big ship, of the lascars
passing silently to and fro on it, of the
children playing about on the hot deck,
and of some young offiicere's wives who
used to try to make her talk to them and
laugh at the things she said.

Principally, she was thinking of what
a queer thing it was that at one time one
was in India in the blazing sun, and then
in the middle of the ocean, and then
driving in a strange vehicle through
strange streets where the day was as
dark as the night. She found this so
puzzling that she moved closer to her
father.

Principally[주로]

'Papa', she said in a low, mysterious
little voice which was almost a whisper,
'Papa'.
'What is it, darling?' Captain Crewe
answered,
holding her closer and looking down into
her face.
'What is Sara thinking of?'
'Is this the place?' Sara whispered,
cuddling still closer to him.
'Is it, Papa?'
'Yes, little Sara, it is. We have reached
it at last.'
And though she was only seven years old, 
she knew that he felt sad when he said it.


It seemed to her many years since he had
begun to prepare her mind for 'the place'
as she always called it. Her mother had
died when she was born, so she had never
known or missed her. Her young, handsome,
rich, petting father seemed to be the only
relation she had in the world.


They had always played together and been 
fond of each other. 
She only knew he was rich because she had 
heard people say so when they thought she 
was not listening, and she had also heard 
them say that when she grew up she would 
be rich, too. She did not know all that
being rich meant.
She had always lived in a beautiful
bungalow, and had been used to seeing many
servants who made salaams to her and
called her "Missee Sahib," and gave her
her own way in everything.
She had had toys and pets and an ayah who 
worshipped her, and she had gradually 
learned that people who were rich had
these things. That, however, was all
she knew about it.
