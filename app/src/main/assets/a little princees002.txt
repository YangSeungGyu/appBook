During her short life only one thing had
troubled her, and that thing was
"the place" she was to be taken to
some day.
The climate of India was very bad for
children, and as soon as possible they
were sent away from it generally to
England and to school.
She had seen other children go away,
and had heard their fathers and mothers
talk about the letters they received
from them. She had known that she would
be obliged to go also, and though
sometimes her father's stories of the
voyage and the new country had attracted
her, she had been troubled by the
thought that he could not stay with her.

"Couldn't you go to that place with me,
papa?"
she had asked when she was five years old.
"Couldn't you go to school, too?
I would help you with your lessons."


"But you will not have to stay for a very
long time, little Sara," he had always
said. "You will go to a nice house where
there will be a lot of little girls, and
you will play together, and I will send
you plenty of books, and you will grow so
fast that it will seem scarcely a year
before you are big enough and clever
enough to come back and take care
of papa."

scarcely[거의~않다, 겨우]

She had liked to think of that. To keep
the house for her father.
to ride with him, and sit at the head of
his table when he had dinner parties.
to talk to him and read his books that
would be what she would like most in the
world, and if one must go away to
"the place" in England to attain it, she
must make up her mind to go.
She did not care very much for other little
girls, but if she had plenty of books she
could console herself.
She liked books more than anything else,
and was, in fact, always inventing stories
of beautiful things and telling them
to herself.
Sometimes she had told them to her father,
and he had liked them as much as she did.

"Well, papa," she said softly, "if we are
here I suppose we must be resigned."
He laughed at her old-fashioned speech and
kissed her.
He was really not at all resigned himself,
though he knew he must keep that a secret.
His quaint little Sara had been a great
companion to him, and he felt he should be
a lonely fellow when, on his return to
India, he went into his bungalow knowing
he need not expect to see the small figure
in its white frock come forward to meet
him.
So he held her very closely in his arms as
the cab rolled into the big dull square in
which stood the house which was their
destination.

It was a big, dull, brick house, exactly
like all the others in its row, but that
on the front door there shone a brass plate
on which was engraved in black letters
: MISS MINCHIN,
