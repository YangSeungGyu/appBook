Miss Minchin's large, fishy smile became
very flattering indeed.
"What an original child!" she said.
"What a darling little creature!"
"Yes," said Captain Crewe, drawing
Sara close.
"She is a darling little creature.
Take great care of her for me,
Miss Minchin."


Sara stayed with her father at his hotel
for several days. in fact, she remained
with him until he sailed away again
to India.
They went out and visited many big shops
together, and bought a great many things.
They bought, indeed, a great many more
things than Sara needed.

[remained:남다]

but Captain Crewe was a rash, innocent
young man and wanted his little girl to
have everything she admired and everything
he admired himself, so between them they
collected a wardrobe much too grand for
a child of seven.

[rash:무모한,성급한]
[admired: 감탄받은]

There were velvet dresses trimmed with
costly furs, and lace dresses, and
embroidered ones, and hats with great,
soft ostrich feathers, and ermine coats
and muffs, and boxes of tiny gloves and
handkerchiefs and silk stockings in such
abundant supplies that the polite young
women behind the counters whispered to
each other that the odd little girl with
the big, solemn eyes must be at least
some foreign princess perhaps the little
daughter of an Indian rajah.

And at last they found Emily, but they
went to a number of toy shops and looked
at a great many dolls before they
discovered her.
"I want her to look as if she wasn't
a doll really," Sara said.
"I want her to look as if she LISTENS
when I talk to her. The trouble with
dolls, papa" and she put her head on
one side and reflected as she said it
"the trouble with dolls is that they
never seem to HEAR." So they looked
at big ones and little ones at dolls with
black eyes and dolls with blue at dolls
with brown curls and dolls with golden
braids, dolls dressed and dolls
undressed.

"You see," Sara said when they were
examining one who had no clothes.
"If, when I find her, she has no frocks,
we can take her to a dressmaker and have
her things made to fit. They will fit
better if they are tried on."
------------------------------
[examining: 검토하다 조사하다]
------------------------------

After a number of disappointments they
decided to walk and look in at the shop
windows and let the cab follow them.
They had passed two or three places
without even going in, when, as they were
approaching a shop which was really not a
very large one, Sara suddenly started and
clutched her father's arm.
[clutched: 와락 움켜잡다]


"Oh, papa!" she cried. "There is Emily!"
A flush had risen to her face and there
was an expression in her green-gray eyes
as if she had just recognized someone
she was intimate with and fond of.
------------------------------
[flush : 홍조를띄다]
------------------------------

"She is actually waiting there for us!"
she said. "Let us go in to her."
"Dear me," said Captain Crewe,
"I feel as if we ought to have someone
to introduce us."
"You must introduce me and I will
introduce you," said Sara.
"But I knew her the minute I saw her so
perhaps she knew me, too."
