"I have locked it," said a queer, polite
little voice from inside.
"I want to be quite by myself,
if you please."
Miss Amelia was fat and dumpy, and stood
very much in awe of her sister.
She was really the better-natured person
of the two, but she never disobeyed
Miss Minchin. She went downstairs again,
looking almost alarmed.


"I never saw such a funny, old-fashioned
child, sister," she said.
"She has locked herself in, and she is not
making the least particle of noise."
"It is much better than if she kicked and
screamed, as some of them do,"
Miss Minchin answered.
"I expected that a child as much spoiled
as she is would set the whole house in
an uproar.
If ever a child was given her own way
in everything, she is."

"I've been opening her trunks and putting
her things away," said Miss Amelia.
"I never saw anything like them sable and
ermine on her coats, and real Valenciennes
lace on her underclothing. You have seen
some of her clothes.
What DO you think of them?"

"I think they are perfectly ridiculous,"
replied Miss Minchin, sharply.
"but they will look very well at the head
of the line when we take the schoolchildren
to church on Sunday. She has been provided
for as if she were a little princess."


And upstairs in the locked room Sara and
Emily sat on the floor and stared at
the corner round which the cab had
disappeared, while Captain Crewe looked
backward, waving and kissing his hand
as if he could not bear to stop.
