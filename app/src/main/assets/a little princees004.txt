She was mistaken, however, in thinking she
was an ugly child.
She was not in the least like Isobel Grange,
who had been the beauty of the regiment,
but she had an odd charm of her own.
She was a slim, supple creature, rather
tall for her age, and had an intense,
attractive little face.
Her hair was heavy and quite black and
only curled at the tips.

her eyes were greenish gray, it is true,
but they were big, wonderful eyes with
long, black lashes, and though she herself
did not like the color of them, many other
people did.
Still she was very firm in her belief
that she was an ugly little girl, and
she was not at all elated by Miss
Minchin's flattery.

"I should be telling a story if I said
she was beautiful," she thought
"and I should know I was telling a story.
I believe I am as ugly as she is in my way.
What did she say that for?"
After she had known Miss Minchin longer
she learned why she had said it.
She discovered that she said the same
thing to each papa and mamma who brought
a child  to her school.


Sara stood near her father and listened
while he and Miss Minchin talked.
She had been brought to the seminary
because Lady Meredith's two little girls
had been educated there, and Captain Crewe
had a great respect for Lady Meredith's
experience.

Sara was to be what was known as "a parlor
boarder," and she was to enjoy even greater
privileges than parlor boarders usually did.

She was to have a pretty bedroom and
sitting room of her own.
she was to have a pony and a carriage, and
a maid to take the place of the ayah who
had been her nurse in India.

"I am not in the least anxious about her
education," Captain Crewe said, with his
gay laugh, as he held Sara's hand and
patted it.
"The difficulty will be to keep her from
learning too fast and too much.
She is always sitting with her little nose
burrowing into books.


She doesn't read them, Miss Minchin.
she gobbles them up as if she were a little
wolf instead of a little girl.
She is always starving for new books to
gobble, and she wants grown up books great,
big, fat ones French and German as well as
English history and biography and poets,
and all sorts of things. Drag her away from
her books when she reads too much.
Make her ride her pony in the Row or go out
and buy a new doll. She ought to play more
with dolls."

"Papa," said Sara, "you see, if I went out
and bought a new doll every few days I
should have more than I could be fond of.
Dolls ought to be intimate friends.
Emily is going to be my intimate friend."

Captain Crewe looked at Miss Minchin and
Miss Minchin looked at Captain Crewe.
"Who is Emily?" she inquired.
"Tell her, Sara," Captain Crewe said,
smiling. Sara's green-gray eyes looked
very solemn and quite soft as she answered.


"She is a doll I haven't got yet," she
said.
"She is a doll papa is going to buy for me.
We are going out together to find her.
I have called her Emily. She is going to be
my friend when papa is gone. I want her to
talk to about him."
