Perhaps she had known her. She had
certainly a very intelligent expression
in her eyes when Sara took her in her arms.
She was a large doll, but not too large
to carry about easily.
she had naturally curling golden-brown
hair, which hung like a mantle about her,
and her eyes were a deep, clear,
gray-blue, with soft, thick eyelashes
which were real eyelashes and not mere
painted lines.

"Of course," said Sara, looking into her
face as she held her on her knee,
"of course papa, this is Emily."
So Emily was bought and actually taken to
a children's outfitter's shop and measured
for a wardrobe as grand as Sara's own.
She had lace frocks, too, and velvet and
muslin ones, and hats and coats and
beautiful lace-trimmed underclothes, and
gloves and handkerchiefs and furs.

"I should like her always to look as if
she was a child with a good mother,"
said Sara. "I'm her mother, though I am
going to make a companion of her."
Captain Crewe would really have enjoyed
the shopping tremendously, but that a sad
thought kept tugging at his heart.
This all meant that he was going to be
separated from his beloved, quaint little
comrade.

He got out of his bed in the middle of
that night and went and stood looking
down at Sara, who lay asleep with Emily
in her arms. Her black hair was spread
out on the pillow and Emily's
golden-brown hair mingled with it, both
of them had lace-ruffled nightgowns,
and both had long eyelashes which lay and
curled up on their cheeks. Emily looked
so like a real child that Captain Crewe
felt glad she was there. He drew a big
sigh and pulled his mustache with
a boyish expression.

"Heigh-ho, little Sara!" he said to
himself "I don't believe you know how much
your daddy will miss you."
The next day he took her to Miss Minchin's
and left her there. He was to sail away
the next morning.
He explained to Miss Minchin that his
solicitors, Messrs. Barrow & Skipworth,
had charge of his affairs in England and
would give her any advice she wanted,
and that they would pay the bills she sent
in for Sara's expenses.
He would write to Sara twice a week, and
she was to be given every pleasure she
asked for.

[solicitors:사무변호사]
------------------------------

"She is a sensible little thing, and she
never wants anything it isn't safe to give
her," he said.
Then he went with Sara into her little
sitting room and they bade each other
good-by.
Sara sat on his knee and held the lapels
of his coat in her small hands, and
looked long and hard at his face.

"Are you learning me by heart, little
Sara?" he said, stroking her hair.
"No," she answered. "I know you by heart.
You are inside my heart." And they put
their arms round each other and kissed
as if they would never let each other go.


When the cab drove away from the door,
Sara was sitting on the floor of her
sitting room, with her hands under her
chin and her eyes following it until
it had turned the corner of the square.
Emily was sitting by her, and she looked
after it, too. When Miss Minchin sent
her sister, Miss Amelia, to see what
the child was doing, she found she
could not open the door.
