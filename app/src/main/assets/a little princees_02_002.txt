"You can read that while I am downstairs," 
she said. and, seeing Mariette looking at 
her curiously, she spoke to her with a 
serious little face.


"What I believe about dolls," she said, 
"is that they can do things they will not 
let us know about. 
Perhaps, really, Emily can read and talk 
and walk, but she will only do it when 
people are out of the room. 
That is her secret. 
You see, if people knew that dolls could 
do things, they would make them work. 
So, perhaps, they have promised each 
other to keep it a secret. If you stay in 
the room, Emily will just sit there and 
stare.
but if you go out, she will begin to 
read, perhaps, or go and look out of 
the window. 
Then if she heard either of us coming, 
she would just run back and jump into 
her chair and pretend she had been 
there all the time."


"Comme elle est drole!" Mariette said to 
herself, and when she went downstairs 
she told the head housemaid about it. 
But she had already begun to like this 
odd little girl who had such an intelligent 
small face and such perfect manners. 
She had taken care of children before 
who were not so polite. 
Sara was a very fine little person, and 
had a gentle, appreciative way of saying, 
"If you please, Mariette," 
"Thank you, Mariette," which was very 
charming. 
Mariette told the head housemaid that 
she thanked her as if she was thanking 
a lady.

"Elle a l'air d'une princesse, cette petite," 
she said. Indeed, she was very much 
pleased with her new little mistress and 
liked her place greatly.

After Sara had sat in her seat in the 
schoolroom for a few minutes, being 
looked at by the pupils, Miss Minchin 
rapped in a dignified manner upon 
her desk.


"Young ladies," she said, "I wish to 
introduce you to your new companion." 
All the little girls rose in their places, 
and Sara rose also. "I shall expect you 
all to be very agreeable to Miss Crewe. 
she has just come to us from a great 
distance--in fact, from India. 
As soon as lessons are over you must 
make each other's acquaintance."


The pupils bowed ceremoniously, and 
Sara made a little curtsy, and then they 
sat down and looked at each other 
again.

"Sara," said Miss Minchin in her 
schoolroom manner, "come here to me."


She had taken a book from the desk and 
was turning over its leaves. 
Sara went to her politely.


"As your papa has engaged a French 
maid for you," she began, 
"I conclude that he wishes you to make 
a special study of the French language."

Sara felt a little awkward.
"I think he engaged her," she said, 
"because he--he thought I would like 
her, Miss Minchin."


"I am afraid," said Miss Minchin, with a 
slightly sour smile, "that you have been 
a very spoiled little girl and always 
imagine that things are done because 
you like them. 
My impression is that your papa wished 
you to learn French."
