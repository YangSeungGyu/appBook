When Sara entered the schoolroom 
the next morning everybody looked 
at her with wide, interested eyes. 
By that time every pupil
-- from Lavinia Herbert, who was 
nearly thirteen and felt quite grown up, 
to Lottie Legh, who was only just four 
and the baby of the school-- 
had heard a great deal about her. 
They knew very certainly that she was 
Miss Minchin's show pupil and was 
considered a credit to the establishment. 
One or two of them had even caught 
a glimpse of her French maid, Mariette, 
who had arrived the evening before. 
Lavinia had managed to pass Sara's room 
when the door was open, and had seen 
Mariette opening a box which had arrived 
late from some shop.

"It was full of petticoats with lace frills 
on them--frills and frills," she whispered 
to her friend Jessie as she bent over her
geography. 
"I saw her shaking them out. I heard 
Miss Minchin say to Miss Amelia that her
clothes were so grand that they were 
ridiculous for a child. 
My mamma says that children should be 
dressed simply. She has got one of those 
petticoats on now. 
I saw it when she sat down."

"She has silk stockings on!" whispered 
Jessie, bending over her geography also. 
"And what little feet! I never saw such 
little feet."


"Oh," sniffed Lavinia, spitefully, "that is 
the way her slippers are made. 
My mamma says that even big feet can 
be made to look small if you have 
a clever shoemaker. 
I don't think she is pretty at all. 
Her eyes are such a queer color."

[spitefully:심술궃게]

"She isn't pretty as other pretty 
people are," 
said Jessie, stealing a glance across the 
room. 
"but she makes you want to look at her 
again. She has tremendously long 
eyelashes, but her eyes are almost green."

Sara was sitting quietly in her seat, 
waiting to be told what to do. 
She had been placed near Miss Minchin's 
desk. She was not abashed at all by the 
many pairs of eyes watching her. 
She was interested and looked back 
quietly at the children who looked at her. 
She wondered what they were thinking 
of, and if they liked Miss Minchin, and 
if they cared for their lessons, and if any 
of them had a papa at all like her own. 
She had had a long talk with Emily about 
her papa that morning.

[abashed:창피한 겸연쩍은]
------------------------------

"He is on the sea now, Emily," she had 
said. 
"We must be very great friends to each 
other and tell each other things. 
Emily, look at me. You have the nicest 
eyes I ever saw--but I wish you could 
speak."


She was a child full of imaginings and 
whimsical thoughts, and one of her 
fancies was that there would be a 
great deal of comfort in even pretending
that Emily was alive and really heard and 
understood.

After Mariette had dressed her in her 
dark-blue schoolroom frock and tied her 
hair with a dark-blue ribbon, she went to 
Emily, who sat in a chair of her own, and 
gave her a book.
