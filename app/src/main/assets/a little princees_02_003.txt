If Sara had been older or less punctilious
about being quite polite to people, she 
could have explained herself in a very 
few words. 
------------------------------
[punctilious:꼼꼼한]
------------------------------

But, as it was, she felt a flush rising on 
her cheeks. 
Miss Minchin was a very severe and 
imposing person, and she seemed so 
absolutely sure that Sara knew nothing 
whatever of French that she felt as if it 
would be almost rude to correct her. 
------------------------------
[severe:엄한,혹독한]
[imposing:위엄있는,눈길을끄는]
------------------------------

The truth was that Sara could not 
remember the time when she had not 
seemed to know French. 
Her father had often spoken it to her 
when she had been a baby. 

Her mother had been a French woman, 
and Captain Crewe had loved her 
language, so it happened that Sara had 
always heard and been familiar with it.


"I--I have never really learned French, 
but--but--" she began, trying shyly to 
make herself clear.


One of Miss Minchin's chief secret 
annoyances was that she did not speak 
French herself, and was desirous of 
concealing the irritating fact. 
------------------------------
[annoyances:짜증남,골칫거리]
[desirous:희망하는]
[concealing:은폐,감추다]
[irritating:자극하다,거슬리다]
------------------------------

She, therefore, had no intention of 
discussing the matter and laying herself 
open to innocent questioning by a new 
little pupil.
------------------------------
[questioning:질의,심문]
------------------------------

"That is enough," she said with polite 
tartness. 
"If you have not learned, you must begin
at once. 
The French master, Monsieur Dufarge, 
will be here in a few minutes. 
Take this book and look at it until he 
arrives."
------------------------------
[tartness:신랄한,산미,시큼함]
------------------------------

Sara's cheeks felt warm. She went back to
her seat and opened the book. 
She looked at the first page with a grave 
face. She knew it would be rude to smile, 
and she was very determined not to be 
rude. 
------------------------------
[grave:심각한,무덤]
------------------------------

But it was very odd to find herself 
expected to study a page which told her 
that "le pere" meant "the father," and 
"la mere" meant "the mother."

Miss Minchin glanced toward her 
scrutinizingly.
------------------------------
[scrutinizingly:유심히,꼼꼼히 살피다]
------------------------------

"You look rather cross, Sara," she said. 
"I am sorry you do not like the idea of 
learning French."
------------------------------
[cross:삐지다]
------------------------------

"I am very fond of it," answered Sara, 
thinking she would try again.
"but--"

"You must not say `but' when you are 
told to do things," said Miss Minchin. 
"Look at your book again."

And Sara did so, and did not smile, 
even when she found that "le fils" meant 
"the son," and "le frere" meant
"the brother."

"When Monsieur Dufarge comes," 
she thought, 
"I can make him understand."

Monsieur Dufarge arrived very shortly 
afterward. He was a very nice, intelligent, 
middle-aged Frenchman, and he looked 
interested when his eyes fell upon Sara 
trying politely to seem absorbed in her 
little book of phrases.
------------------------------
[absorbed:몰두한 빠져있는]
[phrases:구절]
------------------------------

"Is this a new pupil for me, madame?" 
he said to Miss Minchin. "I hope that is 
my good fortune."

"Her papa is very anxious that she should 
begin the language. But I am afraid she 
has a childish prejudice against it. 
She does not seem to wish to learn," 
said Miss Minchin.

"I am sorry of that, mademoiselle," 
he said kindly to Sara. "Perhaps, when we 
begin to study together, I may show you 
that it is a charming tongue."
